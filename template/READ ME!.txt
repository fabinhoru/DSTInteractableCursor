hey, if you’re reading this, you probably want to make your own cursor. so let's get this shit done!!!
what you’ll need:
    - Don’t Starve Mod Tools (look up how to install it if you don’t have it, there's some really good guides out there)
    - an IDE (notepad++, visual studio code, whatever you’re comfy with)
    - an image editor (photopea, gimp, paint.net - just don't pay adobe for photoshop/photoSHIT https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqeKwKSq07g)
    - a bit of lua knowledge
    - a lot, LOT of patience

[[ PREPARING TO MAKE A CURSOR ]]

i’ve included an example cursor as a base, it’s called blood_ice.

for the artwork:
    • as long as you stick to the same resolution, you can draw it however you want!
    • we’ll set the hotspots later, so don’t worry too much about that yet.
    • the blood_ice cursor gives you a good sense of how much space you’ve got to work with.

tip: if you’re making multiple scales, start at 96x96. you can scale it down and adjust as needed instead of redrawing everything for every size.

you’ll need these cursor states:
    • normal → resting/default
    • examine → when hovering over something you can look at but not interact with
    • -clickable → when hovering over something you can interact with
    • drop → when you’re holding something
    • attack → when you’re hovering over something you can attack

[[ USING THE TEMPLATES ]]

once you’ve got your drawings ready, open either cursor_bloody_ice.scml or cursor_bloody_ice_scale.scml.
    • use the first if you’re providing textures for all scales and states.
    • use the second if you have all states but don’t want to export every scale.

these are just templates -- you don’t have to use them, but they’re there if they help make things easier :]

[[ MAKING THE CURSOR ]]

let's do this
    1. open spriter and set the root folder to where your cursor images are.

    2. on the right, you’ll see a list of your sprites.
    drag in the five states for the largest scale. doesn’t matter where you drop them — we can clean that up later.
    i recommend spacing them out a bit to make selection easier.

    3. select a sprite and drag the little white dot to where you want the cursor to “point”, this'll serve as our hotspot.
    this sets the offset the cursor will draw from.
    on the left, set x = 0 and y = 0 to center it.

    4. right-click the white dot and choose overwrite default pivot — this makes sure the compiler grabs the right hotspot.

    5. repeat for all sprites. when you’re done, they should all stack neatly on top of each other. don't worry, it's intended!

inside your animation, set up five layers named exactly like so:
    • _attack
    • _clickable
    • _drop
    • _examine
    • _normal

important: name them exactly like this, or the game won’t hide/show layers properly, and you’ll end up with an amalgamation of cursors!

[[ TIP FOR MULTIPLE SCALES ]]

once you’ve set the pivot points for the largest scale:
    • go to the right menu in spriter.
    • use the copy pivot (icon with two papers) on the large sprite.
    • select the matching smaller sprite, hold ctrl, and select all the smaller versions.
    • use paste pivot (clipboard + paper icon).

this saves you from having to redo hotspots for every sprite at every size.

your animation should look something like:

• custom_cursor (entity, named exactly after your cursor)
→ custom_cursor_96 (scale 96 animation)
→ custom_cursor_80 (scale 80 animation)
→ etc. (all other scales)

for each scale, just duplicate the previous one and right-click + hold on the sprites you want to swap, then pick the lower-scale version from the menu.
it’s tedious, i know.

[[ COMPILING THE CURSOR ]]

i’ve provided a small batch file for convenience.

if you have Don’t Starve Mod Tools installed, just drag and drop your .scml file onto the batch file.
it’ll compile your cursor into the anim folder, and inside, you’ll find your .zip. now it’s ready to use in your mod!

[[ USING THE CURSOR ]]

the example mod i included should show you pretty much everything you need.
you could hook into the cursor system differently, but honestly, i’m too lazy to rewrite this guide for that.

hope this helps! have fun making your cursor :]
